# Monopoly
the solver solves first question then the hint for the first location is opened to the mover to start moving then the mover must scan the qr code for this question for the next to be opened to the solver with each question the solver solves a hint to the node of this question becomes available to the solve if a qr code is found by mover before the solver solves it then a hint to this question appear to solver - some questions don't need a judge like the easy questions in visualization - if the solver is stuck on a question the mover can search for a node and scan the QR code the node have and it will open another question
# Power-ups
(player get one powerup in the beginning(not killswitch): 
## What r the powerups?
1. KillSwitch:
	- very rare -provided by admin/QR code 
2. 50:50: 
	- works on MCQ only 
3. Double rep:
	- double points in one question only 
	- choosen by the player 
4. A golden or risky question:
	- appear in any track after solving 20% of the questions by a time trigger
	- questions that appear are random and disappear in the next time triggers 
	- solver's choice to either answer the Questions or not 
	- failing to solve means failing to solve in time or submitting wrong answer 
	Golden question: (player gets 125%)always hard, tricky can be of any level of difficulties 
	Risky Question: when answered correctly, double total score, when fail to answer, player loses quarter their points

## how to get Powerups: 
- treasure room 4 treasure rooms in real life where it contains a qr code that can be scanned only once.
- only QR codes of the powerups are provided in the treasure rooms(sent to solver)

# Gameplay: 
1. (3 players) 2 solvers, 1 mover .
2. starts in seminar room with 2 solvers while the mover runs around in the university , there are nodes in 4 tracks.
3. if the question is answered correctly the mover gets a hint about the location of the Qr code that when scanned the next question is opened. if not a hint will be shown.
# Miscellaneous notes
- Need a way of communication between solver (I GOT SUPPLIES!!)
